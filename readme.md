Building Office 365 SPAs with Angular and CORS
==============================================

Abstract
--------
> Microsoft recently announced support for CORS in some of their APIs in Office 365 and more coming soon. What this means for developers is that you can create fully client-side solutions that authenticate securely with Azure AD and access data in SharePoint sites using the REST API or files in a user's OneDrive folder. In this session we will look at how we can exploit this in a custom single page app (SPA) using AngularJS.
